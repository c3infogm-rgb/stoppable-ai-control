# stoppable-ai-control

Minimal Fail-Closed AI control loop demo (TG/WORM/IDF).

## What this is

A minimal pattern for building AI systems that:

- STOP when uncertain (HOLD / FREEZE)
- Log reason codes and audit trails
- Resume only after verification (staged recovery)

## Why it matters

Most AI systems optimize for output.
This pattern optimizes for safe non-action.

Designed for:
- Financial systems
- Governance workflows
- Compliance-heavy environments
- Safety-critical AI integration

Uncertainty → HOLD  
Evidence verified → Controlled recovery (+25%/cycle)

This is not "smarter AI".
This is controllable AI.
